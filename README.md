# Landing Page

Welcome to my first landing page project! This static website has been created using basic HTML and CSS with a focus on Flexbox for layout management. This is an initial step in learning web design and layout techniques.

## Project Overview

This project features a landing page designed with Flexbox to handle layout positioning and alignment. The page is styled with custom CSS, but it does not yet include responsive design adjustments. The primary aim is to practice using Flexbox for layout control and understand foundational web design concepts.
Files Included

  - `index.html`: The HTML file containing the structure and content of the landing page.
  - `styles.css`: The CSS file used to style the landing page, utilizing Flexbox for layout.
  - `assets/`: A directory containing image assets used on the page.
